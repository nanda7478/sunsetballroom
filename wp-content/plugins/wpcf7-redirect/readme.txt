== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin disables Contact Form 7 Ajax? =

No, it doesn't. The plugin does not disables any of Contact Form 7 normal behavior, unlike all other plugins that do the same.

= Does this plugin uses "on_sent_ok" additional setting? =

No. One of the reasons we developed this plugin, is because on_send_ok is now deprecated, and is going to be abolished by the end of 2017. This plugin is the only redirect plugin for Contact Form 7 that has been updated to use [DOM events](https://contactform7.com/dom-events/) to perform redirect, as Contact Form 7 developer Takayuki Miyoshi recommends.
