== Description ==

*Change wp-admin login* is a light plugin that allows you easily and safely to change wp-admin to anything you want. It does not rename or change files in core. It simply intercepts page requests and works on any WordPress website. After you activate this plugin the wp-admin directory and wp-login.php page will become unavailable, so you should bookmark or remember the url. Disable this plugin brings your site back exactly to the state it was before.

Go under Settings and then click on "Permalinks" and change your URL under "Change wp-admin login".

Example: http://www.example.com/my-login.
